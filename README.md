# Web-Scarping
Web Scraping in Python
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and dataset from an Article (URL-https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/pastweek?show=124.) 
By reading a web page (https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/pastweek?show=124) using python, have created a dataset by applying a tabular data structure. And Hence exported the dataset into a CSV file name 'Parser for arxiv papers on AI'.
